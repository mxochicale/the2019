# Timeline for the entry opinion to Times Higher Education

## Sep 2019: Expression of interests (EOI)
On 14 of September 2019, I sent an email to "the.submissions@timeshighereducation.com" 
to show my interest to the magazine on submitting an entry in the category of features 
or blogs regarding the publication of the 1st Open Access and %100 PhD thesis since the 
establishment of Birmingham in 1900.
That said, Paul Jump kindly replied my email saying that writing 900 works, or so, 
in the style of a quality newspaper opinion article would be the requirement. 
Additionally, as I don't have much experience on this type of publication, he also 
suggested to follow models for opinions from the Times, Guardian, New York Times, etc.
Hence, this repository is aimed to commit the progress regarding this opinion article.

\maketitle

Surprisingly, %and indepently of the area of research, 
no one to my knowledge have ever published an open access and reproducible thesis 
since the establishment of University of Birmingham in 1900. 
%and with the confirmation of the library services of UoB 
That said, this is my journey for such PhD thesis
%to
%see its light after the examiners accepted the major corrections 
%on June 2019 and
that along to the limitations of time and funding, 
I also face some other challenges, for instance, %when 
being a minority and non-native English speaker.  
%having English d as a native English speaker.
%and limitation such as time, 
%budget-wise, non-native English speaker, and being a minority. 
Those were the variables that acompanimy in this journey 
but always with the mindset of making the sciense that 
I always dreamed of, one which is 
%keep me pushing forward to put together such thesis 
%that tackle basic issues of doing science 
which is reproduciblity and open accessesible with 
open source software.
My hope is that with this post, my PhD thesis has more 
visibility and perhaps others can see the do and dont's,
barriers of publishing this sort of thesis.
%can be used a model for other research in the UK and
%worthwhile.

%Additionally to the little contributions to new knowledge, 
%the effort to make a good narravite in the story of my PhD thesis, 
%one also have to think of making better science. 
%How to do better science with various limitations 
%(i.e. time, budget-wise, non-native English speaker, etc)?

%my case also 
%Putting together a PhD thesis can be daunting but 
%additionally to that, to make better science, one 
%have to pushed a bit more to make it open accessible and reproducible.
%That is my journey, a minority, limited resources, etc.

%when I embark myself on a new jouney called PhD 
%that naively make me think on executing/doing the most marevelous
%research, 
%which as a naively I wanted to research marvelous ideas, 
%performing cool experiments, write up expectacular manuscripts and 
%alos present those results in prestige consferece.
%urns out to be that starting from scratch, those previous points 
%are still far in my lifetime but I have made a little bit of progress


%FIRST YEAR
On November 2014, I started the four-year journey of my PhD,
firstly struggling to put together sentences of not only using 
a new language but using other programming languages and 
tools such as GitHub, python, R, octave. 
%SECOND YEAR
Then for the second year, I created my twitter account, I started
to follow Olivia, find the repositories of Bristol researcher, and
decided to user R because of the advances of reading huge datasets
than python. Also that year I met the Batmat of science, protegenious,
who was an open-eyers by following his twitter post, I learnt 
more and more of the spirit of ROA.
%THIRD YEAR
Then in the third year it was about time to design an experiment, 
collect data and make it open accessible and reproducible,
also collection references for the write up of my thesis. 
%FOUR YEAR
The fourth year then come along with the challenge of 
putting together a thesis where I discovered the repo of 
Rodrigo and its embedded links to the code
and various Github websites with videos and zenodo links.

%PLOT for 
%* number of thesis with code 
%* number of thesis as open access
%* number of thesis that are reproducible


% THE FUTURE
Where is the future of open access and reproducible science,
well, recently I have discovere tools called actions either in 
azure or github which allow you to do  continuous development and 
integration.

 
It is my hope that others also try to have a go to
open access software and make science better by making it
open accessible and \%100 reproducible 
%PhD thesis since the establishment of University of Birmingham 
\citep{xochicale2019-github}.

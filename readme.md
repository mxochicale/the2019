On 14 of September 2019, I sent an email to "the.submissions@timeshighereducation.com" to 
show my interest in submitting an entry in the category of features or blogs.
That said, Paul Jump kindly replied my email saying that writing 900 works, or so, 
in the style of a quality newspaper opinion article would be the requirement. 
Additionally, as I don't have much experience on this, he also suggested 
following models for opinions from the Times, Guardian, New York Times, etc.
That said, this repository is aimed to commit the progress regarding this opinion article.
